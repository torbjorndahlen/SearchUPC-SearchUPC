# Barcode Lookup

This service looks up a barcode by UPC id. It connects with a SOAP service, takes a mixed SOAP and CSV response, and returns JSON back to the client, more effectively mobilising the service.

# Requirements 

The service will only work with node 4 and above. See package.json for more details.
